    <b>Hello. </b>
    I'm a graphic designer who has crossed over to product design. Anything from small functional objects to furniture as well as experiences. In addition, I enjoy research and design with a purpose. I value simplicity, comfort, multi-functionality, and sustainability. Currently I’m pursuing graduate studies at the IIT Institute of Design.
